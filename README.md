# Project 2 Group12

TODO talk about the 3 criteria we target

# Disclaimer

Our group changed our idea midway during Milestone 4. We sent an email to Alex and received approval to change our project idea. We redid Milestones 2 and 3 in [MILESTONES.md](./MILESTONES.md), but kept an archive at the very bottom to show that we put significant effort in our previous ideas and that we submitted previous milestones on time. Please contact our group if there's any questions!

# Use Case & Motivation

TODO define dead code, target users, motivation, problem

TODO why we chose Python

## Static vs Dynamic Analysis

TODO why we chose static analysis

# Getting Started

## Running our project
1. First install all dependencies
   - Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project directory

TODO add more details
- command line usage
  - e.g. -d is debug mode and will print to terminal
- how to interpret the HTML report

## Disclaimer about what we don't support

Please see the section [Future Work](#future-work)

## Running tests

The tests can either be ran by executing the command `python -m pytest`, or alternatively by using the `Testing` tab in VSCode which should discover the tests in our repo.

# Design

TODO impossible 4 properties

## Architecture

TODO use from slides and talk about tech stack

## Code structure

TODO talk about visitor patterns

## Effective variables

## Program slicing & design tradeoffs

TODO talk about enhancements

TODO The design of your program analysis; to what extent does this seem a good fit for the use-case (task and users)?  (LO IIX). If applicable (usually for a static analysis), a sensible choice of trade-offs w.r.t. approximating information about possible executions (LO IX)

## UI

# User Studies

# Future Work
TODO talk about what we don't support & limitations in our project
